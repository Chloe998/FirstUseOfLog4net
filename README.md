# FirstUseOfLog4net
For the final design, I want to add more function on it which is logging. 
I plan to use the ASP.NET to achieve my dynamic web page in C# language.
It can be perform like this:
1. When a user login to the page, generating a .txt file to mark down this info.
2. When a user register a new account, generating a new message into the .txt file.
3. When a mistake shows up made by a user, generating a error message into the .txt file.
Eventrually, it needs to be logged every movement of each users.
